# Rick and Morty Example

## The problem

Using the rick and morty public api [https://rickandmortyapi.com/], create the following response when requesting the information of a character:

```json
{
    "name": "Rick Sanchez",
    "status": "Alive",
    "species": "Human",
    "gender": "Male",
    "firstAppearance": {
        "name": "Pilot",
        "code": "S01E01"
    }
}
```

In order to create this, we need to make two request. The first one will be request the character information using this endpoint

`/api/character/{characterId}`

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Rick Sanchez",
    "status": "Alive",
    "species": "Human",
    "type": "",
    "gender": "Male",
    "origin": {
        "name": "Earth (C-137)",
        "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/1"
    },
    "location": {
        "name": "Earth (Replacement Dimension)",
        "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/20"
    },
    "image": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/avatar/1.jpeg",
    "episode": [
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/1",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/2",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/3",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/4",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/5",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/6",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/7",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/8",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/9",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/10",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/11",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/12",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/13",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/14",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/15",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/16",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/17",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/18",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/19",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/20",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/21",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/22",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/23",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/24",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/25",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/26",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/27",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/28",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/29",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/30",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/31"
    ],
    "url": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1",
    "created": "2017-11-04T18:48:46.250Z"
}
```

We will get into the `episode` array from the first request and extract the first element and perform a request:

`/api/episode/{episideId}`

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Pilot",
    "air_date": "December 2, 2013",
    "episode": "S01E01",
    "characters": [
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/2",
        "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/35",
